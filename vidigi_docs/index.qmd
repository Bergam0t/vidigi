Welcome to vidigi - a package for visualising real or simulated pathways.

{{< video videos/vidigi.mp4 >}}

Primarily developed for healthcare simulation and intended to allow easy integration with tools like Streamlit so users can see the impact of changes to simulation parameters in real-time, vidigi handles the conversion of your simulation event logs into engaging and flexible animations.

With just a minimal set of logs - with helper functions provided to make that easier than ever to integrate into existing SimPy or Ciw simulations - you can start generating and customising your visualisations in minutes.
