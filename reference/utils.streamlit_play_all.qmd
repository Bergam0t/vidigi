# utils.streamlit_play_all { #vidigi.utils.streamlit_play_all }

```python
utils.streamlit_play_all()
```

Programmatically triggers all 'Play' buttons in Plotly animations embedded in Streamlit using JavaScript.

This function uses the `streamlit_javascript` package to inject JavaScript that simulates user interaction
with Plotly animation controls (specifically the play buttons) in a Streamlit app. It searches the parent document
for all elements that resemble play buttons and simulates click events on them.

The function is useful when you have Plotly charts with animation frames and want to automatically start all
animations without requiring manual user clicks.

## Notes {.doc-section .doc-section-notes}

- There is often some small lag in triggering multiple buttons. At present, there seems to be no way to avoid this!
- The JavaScript is injected as a promise that logs progress to the browser console.
- If no play buttons are found, an error is logged to the console.
- This function assumes the presence of Plotly figures with updatemenu buttons in the DOM.
