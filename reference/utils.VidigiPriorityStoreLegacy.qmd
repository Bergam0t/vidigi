```python
utils.VidigiPriorityStoreLegacy()
```

A SimPy store that processes requests with priority.

This class extends the SimPy `Store` to include a priority queue for
handling requests. Requests are processed based on their priority,
submission time, and preemption flag.

Attributes:
    GetQueue (class): A reference to the sorted queue implementation
        used for handling prioritized requests.
    get (class): A reference to the `PriorityGet` class, which handles
        the creation of prioritized requests.
