# utils.EventPosition { #vidigi.utils.EventPosition }

```python
utils.EventPosition()
```

Pydantic model for a single event position.

Attributes:
    event (str): The name of the event. These must match the event names as they appear in your event log.
    x (int): The x-coordinate for the event. This coordinate represents the bottom-right hand corner of the queue or resources.
    y (int): The y-coordinate. This coordinate represents the bottom-right hand corner of the queue or resources.
    label (str): The display label for the event. Used if display_stage_labels = True. This allows you to set a more display-friendly version of your event name (e.g. you might want to display start_queue_till as 'Queuing for Till').
    resource (Optional[str]): The optional resource associated with the event. This must match one of the resource names provided in your scenario object.
