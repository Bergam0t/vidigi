```python
prep.reshape_for_animations(
    event_log,
    every_x_time_units=10,
    limit_duration=10 * 60 * 24,
    step_snapshot_max=50,

Reshape event log data for animation purposes.

This function processes an event log to create a series of snapshots at regular time intervals,
suitable for creating animations of patient flow through a system.

## Parameters {.doc-section .doc-section-parameters}

| Name               | Type      | Description                                                                                | Default        |
|--------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| event_log          | DataFrame | The input event log containing patient events and timestamps.                              | _required_     |
| every_x_time_units | int       | The time interval between snapshots in minutes (default is 10).                            | `10`           |
| limit_duration     | int       | The maximum duration to consider in minutes (default is 10 days).                          | `10 * 60 * 24` |
| step_snapshot_max  | int       | The maximum number of patients to include in each snapshot for each event (default is 50). | `50`           |
| debug_mode         | bool      | If True, print debug information during processing (default is False).                     | `False`        |

## Returns {.doc-section .doc-section-returns}

| Name   | Type      | Description                                                                                                           |
|--------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|        | DataFrame | A reshaped DataFrame containing snapshots of patient positions at regular time intervals, sorted by minute and event. |

## Notes {.doc-section .doc-section-notes}

- The function creates snapshots of patient positions at specified time intervals.
- It handles patients who are present in the system at each snapshot time.
- Patients are ranked within each event based on their arrival order.
- A maximum number of patients per event can be set to limit the number of patients who will be
  displayed on screen within any one event type at a time.
- An 'exit' event is added for each patient at the end of their journey.
- The function uses memory management techniques (del and gc.collect()) to handle large datasets.

## TODO {.doc-section .doc-section-todo}

- Add behavior for when limit_duration is None.
- Consider adding 'first step' and 'last step' parameters.
- Implement pathway order and precedence columns.
- Fix the automatic exit at the end of the simulation run for all patients.
