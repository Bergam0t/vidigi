class CustomResource(simpy.Resource):
    """
    A custom resource class that extends simpy.Resource with an additional ID attribute.

    This class allows for more detailed tracking and management of resources in a simulation
    by adding an ID attribute to each resource instance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    env : simpy.Environment
        The SimPy environment in which this resource exists.
    capacity : int
        The capacity of the resource (how many units can be in use simultaneously).
    id_attribute : any, optional
        An identifier for the resource (default is None).

    Attributes
    ----------
    id_attribute : any
        An identifier for the resource, which can be used for custom tracking or logic.

    Notes
    -----
    This class inherits from simpy.Resource and overrides the request and release methods
    to allow for custom handling of the id_attribute. The actual implementation of ID
    assignment or reset logic should be added by the user as needed.

    Examples
    --------
    ```
    env = simpy.Environment()
    custom_resource = CustomResource(env, capacity=1, id_attribute="Resource_1")
    def process(env, resource):

    A priority-aware request for resources in a SimPy environment.

    This class extends the SimPy `Get` class to allow prioritization of
    resource requests. Requests with a smaller `priority` value are
    served first. The request time and preemption flag are also considered
    when determining the request's order.

    Attributes:
        priority (int): The priority of the request. Lower values indicate
            higher priority. Defaults to 999.
        preempt (bool): Indicates whether the request should preempt
            another resource user. Defaults to True.
            (Ignored by `PriorityResource`.)
        time (float): The simulation time when the request was made.
        usage_since (float or None): The simulation time when the
            request succeeded, or `None` if not yet fulfilled.
        key (tuple): A tuple `(priority, time, not preempt)` used for
            sorting requests.
            Consists of
            - the priority (lower value is more important)
            - the time at which the request was made (earlier requests are more important)
            - and finally the preemption flag (preempt requests are more important)

    Populate a SimPy Store (or VidigiPriorityStore) with CustomResource objects.

    This function creates a specified number of CustomResource objects and adds them to
    a SimPy Store, a VidigiStore, or VidigiPriorityStore.

    Each CustomResource is initialized with a capacity of 1 and a unique ID attribute,
    which is crucial for animation functions where you wish to show an individual entity
    consistently using the same resource.

    If using VidigiPriorityStore, you will need to pass the relevant priority in to the
    .get() argument when pulling a resource out of the store.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_resources : int
        The number of CustomResource objects to create and add to the store.
    simpy_store : simpy.Store or vidigi.utils.VidigiPriorityStore
        The SimPy Store object to populate with resources.
    sim_env : simpy.Environment
        The SimPy environment in which the resources and store exist.

    Returns
    -------

    Notes
    -----
    - Each CustomResource is created with a capacity of 1.
    - The ID attribute of each CustomResource is set to its index in the creation loop plus one,
      ensuring unique IDs starting from 1.
    - This function is typically used to initialize a pool of resources at the start of a simulation.
