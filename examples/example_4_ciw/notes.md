This is adapted from the following repository:
Monks, T., Harper, A., & Heather, A. (2023). Towards Sharing Tools, Artefacts, and Reproducible Simulation: a ciw model example (v1.0.1). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10051494

See here for the adaptation embedded within that repo: [https://github.com/Bergam0t/ciw-example-animation/tree/main](https://github.com/Bergam0t/ciw-example-animation/tree/main)

Please also note this model runs ciw 2.x

It will not run with 3.x - but could theoretically be adapted to do so
